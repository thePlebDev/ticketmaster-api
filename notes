(DONE)1) NAVBAR
2)THE API CALL
2) STYLE THE HOME PAGE
---------desktop version----------------




CREATING THE NAVBAR:
- so I think that this is going to be a pretty normal nav-barand the only thing I want on it is a big old search input
with a search Icon
-  the first thing that we are going to do is to create the fake data that is going to go into our NavBar in the app folder

- so we are going to create the hover index that will change depending on if we are hovering over the link or not
and the navOpen state. this state will be triggered when the nav menu is meant to be open or not.
- we have the ul and for each item in the fake data we are going to create a li will the appropriate stuff.

- so when creating a navigation we should keep a few thigns in mind and they are below

1) create a nav tag
2) create a ul element and have li elements inside of it
3) to make things more dynamic have the li be rendered from the props that are passed into the element. These are the
main steps once we have this in place then its pretty much just styling to do.
4) create a hover effect. this can be done with javascript and use state, while togeling a classname or you could just
use the pusedo css class
5) when we want to make the ul to be layed out properly we just set the display to flex and then use the flex box

CREATING THE RESPONSIVE NAVIGATION:
-we should actually do this first but, next time we do this first, it makes loading faster.
- damn so since I didnt make the RESPONSIVE navigation first
- so we got how we want it to look, lets see if we can get css transtions to work
- for right now the
- we got the animation figured out for the basic slide down of the menu. now lets work on the ref.

REACT REF:
- we are going to use a ref to check if a click is outside of the navbar or not
- we are going to have to use the useRef hook for this one.
- useRef returns a mutable object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument
        const refContainer = useRef(initialValue)
- when we will first create the ref, we will set the initial value to null and then it will get its value
when we assign it to the object
- I think we will still have to hack around it but that shouldn't bee too bad.
- we are also going to use the useEffect ot add the event listener to the document to detect the click

REACT EVENT LISTENERS:
-react uses a single event listener per single event type to invoke all submitted handlers with the virtual dom
- so react uses only one event one event listener per event type to invoke all the submitted handlers of  the virtual
dom, this means that the there is on handler for click events and one for mouseon events and so on
- in react when an event happens react defines it as a synthetic event

- our event handlers will be passed instances of syntheticEvent, which is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's
native event
- the syntheticEvent is pooled. This means that the syntheticEvent object will be resued and all the properties will
be nullified after the event callback has been invoked.
-so a synthetic event is just an object that gets created and has cross browser capability and has the same interface
as the native event.
-so pretty straight forward, very bueno.


DETECTING THE CLICK:
1) create the ref using node = useRef(null) make its initial value null. this creates an objec that will persist the full
lifetime of the object
2) assign it to the object. ref={node}. the ref object on the react element sets its current property to the
corresponding DOM node whenever that node changes
3) add the event listeners on the DOM but using useEffect make sure that they get cleaned up or eles we may get a
memory leak, that would be no bueno.


THE API CALLS:
-so it seems pretty straight forward. we send a request and get a response back. so we want to find music and tech events

music events:
- so we get 5000api requests per day and a rate limiting of 5 requests per second and the page size has to be smaller
than 1000 request items
- so it looks like we have the base url https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/events.json?
- then we have the queries classificationName=music&dmaId=324
- followed by the api key &apikey=z8pipqaTCCTQc1R0OGDLl4bnygjdiXH3

classificationName: this helps with filtering for a genre
dmaId: is some kind of id that is used for filtering.
-so now I want to be able to get musiv events that are close to me
- the API, super easy, we just have to make sure to not send the api requests in the URL

- now we need to figure out how we are going to display the information. I really want a spinner like Netflix, so
lets try to make that.

WHEN DOES REACT DECIDE TO RERENDER SOMETHING:

1)a re-render can only be triggered if a component's state has changed,the props changing can count as a state change
-so more or less whenever something changes it causes a reload.


CREATING THE IMAGE SLIDER:
- so the first thing that we are going to do is to create a card that will be used to display the image. That card
is going to be passed the images. we wrap that card in two div components. the first div will be used to align the card
to the center of the page and the second div will be used to show all the cards next to eachother
- so we are going to loop over the images and for each image we are going to render a card. we will be using map()
for this.
- what does map do?. the map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on
every element in the calling array. so in our case it is going to create a new array that will have a card compoenent
for every image. Map takes a callback and calls it once for every element in the array that it is called on

-the desired effect after we loop over everything is that is should be a a bunch of images stacked on top of eachother

- on the wrapper div we want to set the displayto flex so that we get them aligned side by side and then on the
card element itself we set flex to 1

WHITE SPACE TO THE RIGHT BUG:
- when this bug happens it seems to be due to some kind of disconnect with the html and the body, you need to apply the
following rules to the body and html. width and height both set to 100%, the margin and padding set to 0 and the
overflow-x set to hidden.
